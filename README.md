# Econ 470/HLTH 470: Research in Health Economics

This is the capstone course for the joint major in Economics and Human Health, taught by [Ian McCarthy](http://ianmccarthyecon.com) at Emory University. 

Before going much further, please be sure to read the [syllabus](Syllabus/Econ470-Syllabus.pdf). This provides a sense of what to expect in the course and details of specific assignments and projects. Below are lecture notes and underlying code files for the class. This is very much a work-in-progress, so be sure to check back regularly for updates. Better yet, you can clone the repo via *Git* and then pull regularly to get updates. Please take a look at [these slides](01-Introduction/01-Introduction.html) for guidance on installing and working with Git(Hub). We'll also do this very soon together.


## Moving Online...

As I mentioned in my announcement on Canvas, we are going to pursue a "sychronous" online class schedule and office hours. This means we try to keep our same schedule as we would with in-person classes. This may not work for everyone, as I know some of us are in different time zones and some of us may have intermittent internet access. As a backup option, all of our virtual meetings will be recorded and made available on this website, so the material will be out there if you can't make it to any given "virtual" meeting.

Since our class is relatively small this semester, we will move our class entirely to a virtual classroom with Zoom, and we will meet every Monday and Wednesday from 11:30am to 12:45pm. A link to our Zoom meeting room is available on our class Canvas page. Also on our Canvas page is a separate meeting room link for my Zoom office hours.

**Update 3/30:** Since we've had some barriers attending the virtual class, I'm going to move to a combination of "synchronous" and "asynchronous" classes. Moving forward, I'll post one or two pre-recorded videos for each class. At 12:15pm eastern, I'll open the virtual class on Zoom for any questions and discussion. Hopefully this will work better for everyone as we try to navigate our very different schedules, living situations, and time zones. Thank you so much for your flexibility, and as always, please reach out to me if you have any questions or concerns.


## Notes and Slides
Below are all of the slides that I'll use throughout the class. The slides will open as html files. Note that I've disabled "touch" navigation, which means that it's not possible to advance the slides with a touchscreen. I did this because I will record the screen in each class, and I'll annotate the slides throughout the class. If you want to see the slides in standard presentation format, you will need to access everything on a desktop or laptop rather than a phone or tablet. Everything is still accessible on a mobile platform, you just need to enable "simplified" view (or reader view in some browsers). I've provided a link for that view in each section. The simplified view will remove the slide/presentation formatting and allow you just to see the whole content as one big website. Some content won't display in the same way, but the content itself will be there.

1. Introduction: Motivation and software setup, [slides](01-Introduction/01-slides.html) and [simplified view](01-Introduction/01-simple.html)

2. Struggling with data, [slides](02-DataStruggles/02-slides.html) and [simplified view](02-DataStruggles/02-simple.html)
    + [Data Basics in R](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GieEVVXCunKwGr4Mle_WSajt6HlGraa4/view)

3. Selection on Observables and Hospital Pricing, [slides](03-Selection-HospitalPricing/03-slides.html) and [simplified view](03-Selection-HospitalPricing/03-simple.html)

4. Instrumental variables and demand for cigarettes, [slides](04-IV-Smoking/04-slides.html) and [simplified view](04-IV-Smoking/04-simple.html)

5. Regression discontinuity and Medicare Advantage, [slides](05-RD-MAQuality/05-slides.html) and [simplified view](05-RD-MAQuality/05-simple.html)

6. Difference-in-Differences and Access to Insurance, [slides](06-DD-ACA/06-slides.html) and [simplified view](06-DD-ACA/06-simple.html)

7. Presentations! The dates and links to each of your presentations are below. This is also the order we will discuss your presentations in class.

## Assignments
1. GitHub and Data Management, Due 2/9, \[[Instructions](assignments/hwk-01.html)\] and \[[answers](assignments/hwk-01-answers.html)\]

2. HCRIS Data and Hospital Pricing, Due 3/2, \[[Instructions](assignments/hwk-02.html)\] and \[[answers](assignments/hwk-02-answers.html)\]

3. Smoking Data and Cigarette Demand, Due 3/25, \[[Instructions](assignments/hwk-03.html)\] and \[[answers](assignments/hwk-03-answers.html)\]
  - [Zoom Class Homework Review, March 30](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lrxqC-AACSlHyHBywWx5BaO-mkY8rZTa)

4. Quality and Insurance Choice, Due 4/8, \[[Instructions](assignments/hwk-04.html)\] and \[[answers](assignments/hwk-04-answers.html)\]

5. Medicaid Expansion and Uninsurance Rates, Due 4/22, \[[Instructions](assignments/hwk-05.html)\] and \[[answers](assignments/hwk-05-answers.html)\]. Some people have had issues retrieving the data using an API key. The ACS data are available [here](data/insurance.rds) as an `R` data set and [here](data/insurance.txt) as a tab-delimited text file. These data are the same as the "final.insurance" object in the GitHub repo.

6. Research Project, Final Paper Due 5/4, \[[Instructions](assignments/project.html)\]


## GitHub Repositories
We'll use the following GitHub repositories throughout the course. Each repo deals with a different group of datasets.

1. [Medicare Advantage](https://github.com/imccart/Medicare-Advantage)

2. [HCRIS](https://github.com/imccart/HCRIS)

3. [CDC Tax Burden on Tobacco](https://github.com/imccart/CDC-Tobacco)

4. [ACS and Medicaid Expansion](https://github.com/imccart/Insurance-Access)


## Acknowledgements
This class (and in particular the *R Markdown* formatting and animations) have benefitted significantly from several people who have been generous enough to make their website and other programs available to the public. Some of those people include:

1. [Grant McDermott](https://grantmcdermott.com/) at the University of Oregon. His *GitHub* repository for [Data Science for Economists](https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures) offers a wealth of information.

2. [Nick Huntington-Klein](http://nickchk.com/) at CSU Fullerton. His causal inference animations are hugely helpful, in addition to the notes for his causal inference class. All of this information is available at his website.

3. [Adam Sacarny](http://sacarny.com/) at Columbia University. He has some great hospital data made available through several *GitHub* respositories, this includes repositories for [HCRIS Data](https://github.com/asacarny/hospital-cost-reports) and [Provider of Services Data](https://github.com/asacarny/provider-of-services).

4. [Jenny Bryan](https://jennybryan.org/) has some incredible resources for people learning *R* and *GitHub*. Her and Jim Hester's [Happy Git and GitHub with R](https://happygitwithr.com/) is a great reference.
